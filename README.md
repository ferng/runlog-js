# runlog-js - an exercise log, mainly for running, mainly for me
* Enter and review runs, as in a regular running log. This was written as I didn't want to rely on my garmin and it's website to review past data many years hence

## Running runlog-js
The application uses mongodb to store data, without it an error will be logged and the application will end (to be honest, as it's effectively a db front end it's pretty much useless without a db!)
